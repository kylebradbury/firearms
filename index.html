    <h1>Guns and the United States</h1>
    <p><em>February 29, 2017</em></p>  
    <p class="lead">The United States is an outlier in its relationship with gun ownership when compared to the global community. While civilian guns constitute over 74% of gun ownership around the world, the U.S. has the highest rate of civilian gun ownership in the world at 101 civilian guns per 100 people - more guns than people.</p>

  <p><span class="caption">Figure: Who owns global firearms?</span> The vast majority of global firearms are civilian owned (650 million) compared to the 200 million owned by armed forces and the 26 million by law enforcement. Data Source: Small Arms Survey.</p>

  <div class="col-md-12">
    <p class="lead">In fact, the countries with the next highest gun ownership rate have half as many guns per 100 people (55 per 100 people in Yemen and 46 in Switzerland). </p>

    <p class="lead">Additionally, the gun homicide rate of the U.S. is higher than countries with comparable per capita GDP, particularly Western European countries, Canada, Australia, and Japan. The gun homicide rate of the U.S. is almost triple that of the Switzerland and nearly 30 times as high as the United Kingdom. Uruguay, Paraguay, Argentina, and Sierra Leone have coparable gun homicide rates.</p>

    <p class="lead">For perspective, if we look at the total civilian gun ownership from the top 5 countries by civilian gun ownership, we see that the United States alone constitutes approximately 43% of all civilian guns in the world, even though it represents around 4.4% of the global population.</p>

  <div class="col-md-12">
    <p class="lead">In the United States at the state-level, there is a correlation between the percentage of gun ownership in a state and the rate of gun deaths. New England states tend to have both the lowest percentage (5-25%) of gun ownership as well as the lowest number of gun deaths per capita (3-10 per 100,000 people). The West and Midwest is a bit higher in both gun ownership and per capita gun deaths, whiel the South, particularly the Deep South, generally has both the highest gun ownership (30-56%) and gun death rates (10-19 per 100,000 people).</p>

    <p class="lead">Each country in the world and each state in the United States has different gun laws, and differently cultures and histories with guns. These are hundreds of simultaneous experiments on what works, what preserves safety, and what leads to unecessary violence. It may be time to visit the results of these experiments and see what we can all learn as a global community.</p>
